Hi,

This is a hobby project, created in React Js with the goal of creating a fully functional E-store. Its my attempt to learn React and Redux from scratch while building something fairly complex.

## What's up?

Throughout the project, I have covered these concepts, tools and techniques (The list will be updated as I go)

- React Components, Routing and State management
- Private/protected routes and redirection
- Global state management using Redux
- React hooks
- Complex features like Login, Sign-up, Checkout etc.
- Search functionality with search history, suggestions - use of optimisation techniques like debouncing
- Extensive use of promises, object destructuring, rest/spread operators etc.
- Styling using SASS

## What's planned?

- Mock data currently used to be replaced with a Node.js API that is under construction
- Turn this into a Progressive Web App - implement push notification, app shell, geolocation etc.
- Explore possibility of Facebook/Google log in.

## External libraries used:

### State management
- Redux

### Styling
- React-bootstrap
- FontAwesome

### Forms
- Formik
- Yup

### Networking
- axios

### Others
- lodash
- immer
- joi
- redux-dev-tools-extension

Please feel free to fork the code and suggest improvements.

Thanks,
Aritra
